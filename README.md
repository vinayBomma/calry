Calry is a privacy-first, AI-powered nutrition tracker built with React Native and Expo. It allows you to log meals using natural language, providing instant nutritional insights while keeping your data securely on your device.

## Features

- **Favourites**: Save your frequent meals for quick, one-tap logging.
- **Interactive Stats**: Visualize your weekly progress with bar charts and real-time calorie rings.
- **Smart Goals**: Set calorie and macro goals. The app can auto-recalculate them based on your profile stats (TDEE).

- **Celebrations**: Get a confetti surprise when you hit your daily goals!

## AI Safety & Limits

- **Guardrails**: The AI is programmed to only answer nutrition-related queries.
- **Limits**: Text inputs are capped at 200 characters to prevent token overuse and ensure focus.
